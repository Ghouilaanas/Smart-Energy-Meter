# ðŸ“Ÿâš¡ Smart-Energy-Meter
This project implements a prototype Smart Energy Meter developed on an Arduino Uno board powered by the ATmega328P microcontroller, designed to provide real-time monitoring and control of household or industrial electrical loads. The prototype focuses on enhancing traditional metering systems by enabling remote data collection, energy consumption analysis, and load status supervision through IoT-based communication.
