# Smart-Energy-Meter
Part of an end-of-year project, this work focused on a Smart Energy Meter prototype designed to remotely monitor the status and consumption of electrical loads. The system aimed to enhance conventional energy metering by reducing energy usage, and supporting efficient management through improved control and communication features.
