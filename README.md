# ðŸ“Ÿâš¡ Smart-Energy-Meter
This project implements a prototype Smart Energy Meter developed on an Arduino Uno board powered by the ATmega328P microcontroller, designed to provide real-time monitoring and control of household or industrial electrical loads. The prototype focuses on enhancing traditional metering systems by enabling remote data collection, energy consumption analysis, and load status supervision through IoT-based communication.
## ðŸ“„ Description
The system integrates the ACS712 current sensor to measure the current drawn by various electrical loads such as 220V lights, fans, and other appliances, ensuring accurate monitoring of individual and total power consumption. The Arduino Uno serves as the central processing unit, handling current measurement, signal processing, and energy usage calculation in real-time.
For communication, the prototype employs the SIM800L GSM/GPRS module, allowing the system to transmit consumption data to a remote user or server via SMS
